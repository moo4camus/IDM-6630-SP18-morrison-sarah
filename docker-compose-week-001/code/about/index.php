    <p>Cherilyn "Cher" Horowitz is a sweet, sometimes airhead-like blonde teenager who lives with her father in Beverly Hills, California. Cher often speaks in Valley Girl slang. Cher is popular with her classmates; she often uses her social status (and social know-how) to aid others. Yet these crusades are not always as successful as she would wish.</p>

    <p>Cher usually has an agenda for helping others, but the agenda is never a cruel one. As the daughter of a lawyer, Cher has developed extensive conversational skills. However, Cher's efforts to talk her way out of trouble are not always successful. Cher's knowledge is not without flaws, particularly in relation to certain elements of history and culture.<p> 

    <p>Overall, Cher is the person to consult when you need a "clue." Just don't give her the keys to your SUV.</p>
